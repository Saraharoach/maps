For this project, I wanted to understand where low performing schools are located and what communities they affect in my home-city of Louisville. For the comparison map, I wanted to see how these schools were potentially influenced by redlining practices.

## Project 2, GEO 309 Final Project (Fall 2020)

For project 2, I wanted to see if there was any correlation between asthma rates, poverty, and proximity to polluting factories identified by the EPA. I was surprised that the vast majority of these factories are located in low-income areas.

For project 3, we were tasked with creating a map of arches in Red River Gorge. As someone who hasn't visited this area in a while, creating this map helped me to better understand where I was mapping.
